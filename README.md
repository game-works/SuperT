# SuperT - A game made using Qt/QGraphicsView framework.
MIT license.

This game is a second iteration (or should I say tentative) to make a simple game. The motivation was to improve my understanding of Qt/QGraphics framework. Some of the design ideas were copied from this great book: http://www.gameprogrammingpatterns.com/

There is a ton of things to improve, ranging from design (maybe use composition in form of an ECS) and performance, there are some performance degradation when a lot of entities are displayed. Probably some bugs here and there too. I hope this code is useful to other people as an educational tool for making applications in C++ and Qt.
